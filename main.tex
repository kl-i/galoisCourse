\section{The main theorem of Galois theory}

We show an example of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.
Consider the polynomial $f(T) = T^3 - 2 \in \bQ[T]$.
Let $\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2 \in \bC$ be the roots of $f$.
\[
  \text{Slogan : Galois theory studies the ``symmetries'' of 
  roots of polynomials}
\]
To make this precise, let us first investigate the field obtained
by chucking in $\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2$ to $\bQ$.
Define \[
  \bQ_f := \bQ(\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2) := 
  \text{ smallest field in $\bC$ containing $\bQ , \al_0 , \al_1 ,\al_2$}
\]
\textbf{Question 0 : What does $\bQ_f$ look like?}
We try to describe $\bQ(\al_0)$ first.
Consider the map $T \mapsto \al_0$ 
\begin{cd}
	{\mathbb{Q}[T]} & {\mathbb{C}} \\
	{\mathbb{Q}(\alpha_0)}
	\arrow["{T \mapsto \al_0}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[dashed, from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["\subseteq"', from=2-1, to=1-2]
\end{cd}
The image is $\bQ[\al_0]$ the collection of polynomial expressions
in $\al_0$ with coefficients in $\bQ$.
Since $f \in \bQ[T]$ is irreducible\footnote{
  Can be checked by Eisenstein's criterion.
  Alternatively, a cubic over $\bQ$ is reducible iff
  it has a root in $\bQ$.
  This can be checked to be impossible by brute force.
}
we have $\bQ[\al_0] = \bQ[T] / (f)$
and hence this has a $\bQ$-basis $1 , \al_0 , \al_0^2$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{
    Exercise 1 :  show that for a field $K$ and 
    an $K$-algebra $A$ which is finite dimensional 
    as a $K$-vector space and an integral domain,
    $A$ must be field.
  }
\end{itemize}
It follows that $\bQ[\al_0]$ is a field and hence
\[
  \bQ[\al_0] = \bQ(\al_0)
\]
Now we do a trick by observing that \[
  \brkt{\frac{\al_1}{\al_0}}^3 = 2 / 2 = 1
\]
Later on, we will give a way of checking when a polynomial has repeated roots
so assume for now that all $\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2$ are distinct.
Then we get $\al_1 = \al_0 \om$ for some $\om \neq 1 = \om^3$,
and similarly $\al_2 = \al_0 \om^2$.
The $\om, \om^2$ here are called a \emph{primitive cube roots of unity}.
They are both roots of the polynomial $T^2 + T + 1 \in \bQ[T]$.
In the next section, we will be able to show that $\om \notin \bQ(\alpha_0)$.
Taking this for granted for now,
$T^2 + T + 1$ does not have a root in $\bQ(\al_0)$,
so it is irreducible in $\bQ(\al_0)[T]$.
It follows that \[
  \bQ[\al_0 , \om] \simeq \bQ[\al_0][T] / (T^2 + T + 1)
\]
As a $\bQ[\al_0]$-vector space, this has dimension two and
hence is again a field by Exercise 1. 
We deduce 
\textbf{Answer 0 :} \[
  \bQ(\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2) = \bQ[\al_0 , \om] = \bQ[\al_0 , \al_1 ,\al_2]
\]

We now define \emph{the Galois group of $f$} as \[
  G_f := \AUT_\bQ \bQ(\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2)
  := \set{\si : \bQ_f \to \bQ_f \st \si \text{ ring morphism and }
  \forall\,\la \in \bQ\,,\,\si(\la) = \la}
\]
\textbf{Question 1 : Why is this the ``symmetries'' of $\al_0 , \al_1 ,\al_2$?}
Observation : any $\si \in G_f$ must permute $\set{\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2}$.
This is \textbf{\emph{the} trick} that underlies Galois theory : \[
  f(\si(\al_i)) = (\si(\al_i))^3 - 2 = \si(\al_i^3 - 2) = 0
\]
Hence we have a well-define group morphism \[
  G_f \to \AUT\set{\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2}
\]
Since $\bQ_f = \bQ[\al_0 , \al_1 ,\al_2]$ any $\si \in G_f$
is determined by what it does on $\al_i$ hence the above morphism is injective.
\textbf{Answer 1 : The above morphism defines an isomorphism}
\[
  G_f \simeq \set{
    \si \in \AUT\set{\al_0 ,\al_1 ,\al_2} \st 
    \forall g \in \bQ[X_0 , X_1 , X_2] \,,
    g(\al_0 , \al_1 ,\al_2) = 0 \implies
    g(\si(\al_0) , \si(\al_1) , \si(\al_2)) = 0
  }
\]
\textbf{in other words, $G_f$ is the permutations of roots of $f$
which preserves all algebraic relations over $\bQ$.}
\begin{proof}
  $\bQ[\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2]$ is precisely the image of 
  the evaluation map \[
    \bQ[X_0 , X_1 , X_2] \to \bQ[\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2] \,,\,X_i \mapsto \al_i
  \]
  It follows that $
    \bQ[\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2] \simeq 
    \bQ[X_0 , X_1 , X_2] / I
  $ where $I$ is the set of polynomials $g(X_0 , X_1 , X_2)$ with
  $g(\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2)$.
  From this, it is clear that $G_f$ lands inside the RHS.
  Now given $\tilde{\si}$ in RHS,
  one can evaluate \[
    \bQ[X_0 , X_1 , X_2] \to \bQ[\al_0 , \al_1 ,\al_2] \,,\, 
    X_i \mapsto \tilde{\si}(\al_i)
  \]
  Then by definition $I$ is in the kernel of this evaluation map
  so it factors through the quotient by $I$ to give
  an automorphism of $\bQ(\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2)$ preserving $\bQ$.
\end{proof}
Let us now compute $G_f$. We have the following
\begin{align*}
  \bQ_f = \bQ[\al_0 , \om] 
  = \bQ[\al_0][\om]
  \simeq \frac{\bQ[\al_0][Y]}{(Y^2 + Y + 1)}
  \simeq \frac{\bQ[X][Y]/(X^3 - 2)}{(X^3 - 2 , Y^2 + Y + 1)/(X^3 - 2)}
  \simeq \frac{\bQ[X , Y]}{(X^3 - 2 , Y^2 + Y + 1)}
\end{align*}
where the last isomorphism is the 3rd isomorphism theorem of rings.
Consider the 3-cycle $\si := (\al_0 \,\, \al_1 \,\, \al_2)$.
Knowing $\om = \al_1 / \al_0$ we send $X \mapsto \al_1 , Y \mapsto \omega$.
\begin{cd}
  {\mathbb{Q}[X , Y]} & {\mathbb{Q}[\alpha_0 , \omega]} \\
	{\mathbb{Q}[\alpha_0 , \omega]}
	\arrow["\begin{array}{c} \begin{matrix}X \mapsto \alpha_1 \\ Y \mapsto \omega\end{matrix} \end{array}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["\begin{array}{c} \begin{matrix}X \mapsto \alpha_0 \\ Y \mapsto \omega\end{matrix} \end{array}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["\simeq"', dashed, from=2-1, to=1-2]
\end{cd}
We get the factoring because $\al_1^3 - 2 = 0 = \om^2 + \om + 1$
and so $\si \in G_f$.
Now consider $\tau := (\al_0 \,\, \al_1)$.
Again, since $\om = \al_1 / \al_0$ we know 
$\tau$ should send $\om \mapsto 1 / \om = \om^2$ so we send 
$X \mapsto \al_0 , Y \mapsto \omega^2$.
\begin{cd}
  {\mathbb{Q}[X , Y]} & {\mathbb{Q}[\alpha_0 , \omega]} \\
	{\mathbb{Q}[\alpha_0 , \omega]}
	\arrow["\begin{array}{c} \begin{matrix}X \mapsto \alpha_1 \\ Y \mapsto \omega^2\end{matrix} \end{array}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["\begin{array}{c} \begin{matrix}X \mapsto \alpha_0 \\ Y \mapsto \omega\end{matrix} \end{array}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["\simeq"', dashed, from=2-1, to=1-2]
\end{cd}
Again $\al_1^3 - 2 = 0 = (\om^2)^2 + \om^2 + 1$ gives the above factoring
and hence $\tau \in G_f$.
It follows that $G_f$ is the whole of $\AUT\set{\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2}$.

Symmetry means ``changes that cannot be observed''.
The symmetries of a triangle are the ways you can change the triangle
such that you cannot tell the difference between before and after.
In the same way, $G_f$ are the ways you can swap of roots of $f$
such that as far as $\bQ$ can tell, nothing has changed.
In this example, there is nothing special about $\al_0$;
the whole argument works starting with $\al_1$ or $\al_2$.
The roots are equally ambiguous, which is reflected
in the quantitative fact that $G_f \simeq S_3$.
An example of less ambiguity is $T^3 - 1$.
The roots are $1, \om , \om^2$.
The Galois group of $T^3 - 1$ is cyclic order two generated by 
$\om \mapsto \om^2$.
This reflects the fact that 1 is more special than $\om, \om^2$
whilst the latter cannot be distinguished from each other.
Indeed if one writes $\mu := \om^2$ then $\om = \mu^2$.

Back to $T^3 - 2$. 
Observe that $\bQ \subs \bQ_f^{G_f} := $
the set of elements in $\bQ_f$ fixed by $G_f$.
\textbf{Claim : $\bQ = \bQ_f^{G_f}$.}
Let $x\in \bQ_f$ be fixed by $G_f$.
We approach $\bQ_f$ this time by adding $\om$ first then $\al_0$.
Since $\bQ_f = \bQ[\om][\al_0]$ we can write
\[
  x = \la_0 + \la_1 \al_0 + \la_2 \al_0^2
\]
for $\la_i \in \bQ(\om)$.
Then since $\si(\om) = \om$ we have \[
  x = \si(x) = \la_0 + \la_1 \om \al_0 + \la_2 \om^2 \al_0^2
\]
Since $1 , \al_0 , \al_0^2$ are a $\bQ(\om)$-basis for $\bQ_f$,
we can compare coefficients to get $\la_1 = \la_1 \om$ and $\la_2 = \la_2 \om^2$
This implies $\la_1 = 0 = \la_2$ and so $x \in \bQ(\om)$.
Now $x = \mu_0 + \mu_1 \om$ for $\mu_i \in \bQ$.
Then \[
  x = \tau(x) = \mu_0 + \mu_1 \om^2
  = (\mu_0 - \mu_1) - \mu_1 \om
\]
which implies $\mu_1 = - \mu_1$ and so $\mu_1 = 0$.
We find that $x \in \bQ$.
More generally, given any subgroup $H$ of $G_f$ 
we can compute the \emph{fixed subfield} $\bQ_f^H$.
Here is a diagram of all the subgroups of $G_f$ and their corresponding
fixed subfields.

The fundamental theorem of Galois theory says
this is all of them.
To be more precise, we make some definitions.

\begin{dfn}[Galois extension]

  Let $K \to L$ be an extension of fields.
  We often identify $K$ with its image in $L$.
  We call it \emph{Galois} when there is a finite group $G \subs \AUT_K L$
  such that $K = L^G$. 
\end{dfn}
The extension earlier $\bQ \subs \bQ(\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2)$ was an example
of a Galois extension.
\begin{prop}[Fundamental theorem of Galois theory]

  Let $K \to L$ be a Galois extension of fields
  and let $G := \AUT_K L$.
  Consider the following two constructions : 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Given a subgroup $H \subs G$,
    define $L^H$ as the set of fixed points of $L$ by $H$.
    This defines a field containing the image of $K$.
    \item Given a subfield $M \subs L$ containing $K$,
    define $\AUT_M L$ as the subgroup of $G$ acting trivially on $M$.
  \end{itemize}
  Then we have an order reversing bijection \begin{cd}
    {\set{\text{subextensions }M\subseteq L}} & {\set{\text{subgroups of }\mathrm{Aut}_K L}}
    \arrow["{\mathrm{Aut}_\_ L}", shift left=3, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow["\simeq"{description}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow["{L^\_}", shift left=3, from=1-2, to=1-1]
  \end{cd}
\end{prop}
The Galois extension $\bQ_f / \bQ$ is an example of a \emph{solvable} extension.
\begin{dfn}

  Let $K \to L$ be a field extensions.
  We say it is \emph{radical} when
  there exists a chain of extensions 
  \[
    K = L_0 \to L_1 \to \cdots \to L_{n-1} \to L_n = L
  \]
  such that each $L_{i+1} = L_i(\al_i)$
  for some $\al_i$ with $\al_i^{d_i} \in L_i$ for some $d_i > 0$.

  We say a polynomial $f \in K[T]$ is \emph{solvable by radicals}
  when $K_f / K$ is radical.
\end{dfn}

Notice that in the example, that the sequence of groups 
\[
  1 \to \langle(\alpha_0 \,\,\alpha_1 \,\,\alpha_2)\rangle \to G_f
\]
is such that one subgroup is normal in the next
and furthermore that the factor groups are cyclic.
This is an example of a \emph{solvable group}.

\begin{dfn}
  
  Let $G$ be a finite group.
  Then $G$ is called solvable when
  there exists a chain \[
    1 = H_0 \triangleleft H_1 \triangleleft
    \cdots \triangleleft H_{n-1} \triangleleft H_n = G
  \]
  such that $H_{n+1} / H_n$ is cyclic.
\end{dfn}

We will show the following by the end of the course.
\begin{prop}[Characteristization of solvable polynomials]
  
  Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and $f \in K[T]$.
  Then $f$ is solvable by radicals iff $G_f$ is solvable.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  The polynomial $T^5 - T - 1 \in \bQ[T]$ has Galois group $S_5$
  and hence is not solvable by radicals.
\end{prop}

% \subsection{Cubic equation}

% Using the fundamental theorem of Galois theory
% we derive the cubic equation.
% Let $f(T) = T^3 + a T^2 + b T + c \in \bQ[T]$.
% Let $S = \set{\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2} \subs \bC$ be the set of solutions 
% to $f(x) = 0$.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Goal : express $\al_i$ using $\bQ , + , - , \times, \div , \sqrt[n]{\_}$
% \end{itemize}
% First, a simplification
% \[
%   f(T - a / 3) = T^3 + 3 p T + 2 q
% \]
% so we will solve $f(T) = T^3 + 3 p T + 2 q$ instead.
% Since we are solving cubics, it is conceivable that
% we may need cube roots of 1 at some point.
% Choose a primitive cube root of unity $\om \neq 1 = \om^3$.
% This is okay for our goal because $\om^2 + \om + 1 = 0$
% so $\om$ can be solved by radicals from $\bQ$.
% We thus change our base field to $K := \bQ(\om)$.
% Consider the elements in $\bC$ : 
% \begin{align*}
%   u &= \al_0 + \om \al_1 + \om^2 \al_2 \\
%   v &= \al_0 + \om^2 \al_1 + \om \al_2
% \end{align*}
% Note that we can express the roots in terms of $u , v$ : 
% using $\om^2 + \om + 1 = 0$ we have
% \begin{align*}
%   u + v = 2 \al_0 + (\om + \om^2) \al_1 + (\om + \om^2) \al_2
%   = 2 \al_0 - \al_1 - \al_2 = 3 \al_0 \\
% \end{align*}
% so $\al_0 = (u + v) / 3$ and similarly $\al_1 = (\om u + \om^2 v) / 3 , 
% \al_2 = (\om^2 u + \om v) / 3$.

% We investigate how elements of $\AUT\set{\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2}$
% acts on $u$ and $v$.
% Let $\si = (\al_0 \,\,\al_1 \,\,\al_2)$.
% Then \begin{align*}
%   \si(u) = \om^2 u \\
%   \si(v) = \om v
% \end{align*}
% Let $\tau = (\al_1 \,\,\al_2)$ then
% \begin{align*}
%   \tau(u) = v \\
%   \tau(v) = u 
% \end{align*}
% Since $\si , \tau$ generate $\AUT\set{\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2}$,
% no matter what $G_f$ is it must fix $u^3 + v^3 , u v$
% and hence by the fundamental theorem $u^3 + v^3 , u v \in K$.
% An explicit computation shows : 
% \begin{align*}
%   u v &= - 3^2 p \\
%   u^3 + v^3 &= - 3^3 2 q
% \end{align*}
% Then $u^3$ and $v^3$ are the solutions to $T^2 + 3^3 2 q T - 3^6 p^3 \in K[T]$, 

\section{Finite extensions and the embedding theorem}

We saw in the previous section that 
$\om \in \bQ(\al_0)$ precisely when there is a solution to $T^2 + T + 1$
inside $\bQ(\al_0)$.
Accordingly, there is no copy of $\bQ(\om)$ inside $\bQ(\al_0)$.
This section investigates this phenomenon.
We didn't formally define field extensions last time.

\begin{dfn}
  A field extension is a ring morphism $\io : K \to L$ between fields.
  
  Since fields have no non-trivial ideals,
  any field extension $\io : K \to L$ must be injective.
  When it is clear, we often identify $K$ with its image $\io K$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{eg}
  Here is an example of a field extension from a field to itself.
  Let $\bQ(T) := \mathrm{Frac}\,\bQ[T]$.
  Define $\bQ[T] \to \bQ[T] , T \mapsto T^2$.
  Then this induces a field extension $\bQ(T) \to \bQ(T)$
  where the image of the first copy is $\bQ(T^2)$.
\end{eg}

A basic invariant of a field extension is its degree.

\begin{dfn}[Degree of an extension]
  Let $K \to L$ be a field extension.
  Define its \emph{degree} as $[L : K] := \dim_K L$.
  It is called finite when $[L : K] < \infty$.
\end{dfn}

When proving things about a finite extension $K \to L$,
we will often do so by inducting on $[L : K]$.
The following is useful.

\begin{prop}[Tower law]
  
  Let $K \to L \to N$ be extensions of fields.
  Then $[N : K] = [N : L][L : K]$.
  In particular, a sequence of finite extensions is finite.
\end{prop}
The following argument works for infinite extensions,
though we will mostly be interested in finite extensions.
\begin{proof}
  Let $B_L \subseteq L$ be a $\io_L$-basis and 
  $B_N \subseteq N$ a $\io_N$-basis. 
  The claim is that $B_L B_N := \{ a b \,|\, a \in B_L, b \in B_N\}$
  is a $(\io_N \circ \io_L)$-basis of $N$ and has cardinality $B_L \times B_N$.

  (Cardinality) Let $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) \in B_L \times B_N$
  such that $ a_1 b_1 = a_2 b_2$. 
  This is then a non-trivial $L$-linear combination of elements in $B_N$,
  contradicting linear independence of $B_N$.
  The cardinality is thus as desired. 

  (Linear Independence) 
  Let $\sum_{(a, b) \in B_L \times B_N} \la_{a,b} a b = 0$
  where $\la_{a,b} \in K$ and only finitely many are non-zero. 
  Then we have 
  $\sum_{b \in B_N} \left(\sum_{a \in B_L} \la_{a,b} a\right) b = 0$,
  giving $\sum_{a \in B_L} \la_{a,b} a = 0$ by linear independence of $B_N$,
  which in turn gives $\la_{a,b} = 0$ by linear independence of $B_L$.
  
  (Spanning) 
  Let $x \in N$. 
  Since $B_N$ is spanning, we have $\sum_{b \in B_N} \la_b b = x$ 
  for some $\la_b \in L$, finitely many non-zero. 
  Then since $B_L$ is spanning, 
  we have $\sum_{a \in B_L} \mu_{a,b} a = \la_b$ for each $b \in N_B$, 
  where $\mu_{a,b} \in K$, finitely many non-zero. 
  So $\sum_{(a,b) \in B_L \times B_N} \mu_{a, b} a b = x$ as desired. 
\end{proof}

\begin{eg}
  Now we can show $\om \notin \bQ(\al_0)$ from the previous section.
  We have $3 = [\bQ(\al_0) : \bQ] = [\bQ(\al_0) : \bQ(\om)] [\bQ(\om) : \bQ]
  = [\bQ(\al_0) : \bQ(\om)] 2$ which is a contradiction because 2 does not
  divide 3.
\end{eg}

\begin{dfn}
  
  Let $K \to L$ be a field extension.
  For $A \subs L$, define $K(A) \subs L$ as the smallest
  subfield of $L$ containing the image of $K$ and $A$.
  We say $K \to L$ is finite type when 
  there exists finite $A \subs L$ with $L = K(A)$.
  In the case of $A = \set{a}$, we write $K(a)$.
  We call extensions of the form $K \to K(a)$ simple.

  Given $a \in L$, one can consider the evaluation 
  ring morphism \[
    \ev_a : K[T] \to L , f(T) \mapsto f(a)
  \]
  We say $a$ is \emph{algebraic over $K$} when
  there exists a non-zero $f$ with $f(a) = 0$,
  i.e. $0 \neq \ker \ev_a$.
  
  We say $K \to L$ is algebraic when
  all $a \in L$ is algebraic over $K$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{prop}[\link{char_ext_simp}{Characteristization of finite simple extensions}]
  Let $K \to L$ be an extension and $a \in L$.
  Then the following are equivalent : 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $a$ is algebraic over $K$
    \item $[K(a) : K]$ is finite
    \item $K \to K(a)$ is algebraic.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  ($1 \implies 2$) 
  We saw in section 1 how to compute $K(a)$.
  Specifically, consider the evaluation map $K[T] \to L , f \mapsto f(a)$
  and let $K[a]$ be its image.
  By assumption, there exists non-zero $f \in K[T]$ with $f(a) = 0$.
  WLOG $\deg f = N \geq 0$.
  Then $1 , a , \dots, a^{N-1}$ is a $K$-spanning set for $K[a]$.
  This implies $K[a]$ is a finite dimensional $K$-vector space
  and hence a field and hence $K[a] = K(a)$.

  ($2 \implies 3$)
  Let $b \in K(a)$.
  Since $[K(a) : K]$ is finite,
  there exists a non-trivial linear combination
  $0 = \sum_{n \geq 0} \la_n b^n$ with $\la_n \in K$,
  which implies $b$ is algebraic over $K$.

  ($3 \implies 1$) trivial.

  The following are equivalent : 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $[L : K]$ is finite
    \item $K \to L$ is finite type and algebraic 
    \item There exists finite $A \subs L$ such that $L = K(A)$ and
    all $a \in A$ are algebraic.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  ($1 \implies 2$) Take a $K$-basis and use \linkto{char_ext_simp}{
    the characterization of finite simple extensions

  ($2 \implies 3$) Clear.
  ($3 \implies 1$)
  Induct on the size of $A$ and use 
  \linkto{char_ext_simp}{
    the characterization of finite simple extensions

\end{proof}

We are now ready for the main result of this section.

\begin{prop}[Embedding theorem for finite simple extensions]
  
  Let $K \to L$ be an extension and $a \in L$ algebraic over $K$.
  The ideal $\ker \ev_a \subs K[T]$ is generated by a unique
  monic polynomial.
  We call it the \emph{minimal polynomial of $a$ over $K$},
  denoted $\min(a , K)$.
  Let $K \to N$ be another extension.
  Then we have a bijection \[
    \EMB_K(K(a) , N) \simeq \set{b \in N \st \min(a , K) = \min(b , K)},
    \varphi \mapsto \varphi(a)
  \]
  In particular, $\abs{\EMB_K(K(a) , N)} \leq [K(a) : K]$.
  Elements $b \in N$ with $\min(b , K) = \min(a , K)$ are called 
  \emph{Galois conjugates of $a$}.

\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  We saw $K(a) = K[a] \simeq K[T]/(\min(a , K))$.
  Given $\varphi : K(a) \to N$ a $K$-embedding,
  the composition $K[T] \to K(a) \to N$ is $\ev_{\varphi(a)}$.
  Since $K(a) \to N$ is injective, we have $\ker \ev_{\varphi(a)} = \ker \ev_a$.
  It follows that $\min(\varphi(a) , K) = \min(a , K)$.
  Conversely, given $b \in N$ a Galois conjugate of $a$ we can define the
  $K$-embedding $K(a) \simeq K[T] / (\min(a , K)) = K[T] / (\min(b , K))
  \simeq K(b) \subs N$.
\end{proof}

We will now generalise the above to general finite extensions.
For this, we need to know how embeddings from subextensions
interact with the whole extension.

\begin{prop}[Subextensions partition embeddings]
  
  Let $K \to L \to M$ and $K \to N$ be extensions.
  Then we have a bijection \[
    \bigsqcup_{\io \in \EMB_K(L , N)} \EMB_L(M , N) \map{\sim}{} \EMB_K(M , N)
  \]
  by sending $(L \to N \in \EMB_K(L , N) , M \to N \in \EMB_L(M , N))$
  to $M \to N$ viewed as a $K$-embedding.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  The point is that we have a map $\EMB_K(M , N) \to \EMB_K(L , N)$
  and the fibers over each $\io : L \to N$ is precisely
  the set of $L$-embeddings $M \to N$ where $N$ is viewed as
  an $L$-extension by $\io : L \to N$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[Embedding theorem for finite extensions]
  
  Let $K \to L$ be an extension and $A \subs L$ finite set of algebraic
  generators for $L$ over $K$.
  Let $K \to N$ be another extension and assume that
  for all $a \in A$ the minimal polynomial $\min(a , K)$ splits
  into linear factors in $N[T]$.
  Then \[
    0 < \abs{\EMB_K(L , N)} \leq [L : K]
  \]
  and we have equality if for all $a \in A$ the polynomial $\min(a , K)$
  has no \emph{repeated} roots in $N$. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Induct on the cardinality of $A$.
  $A = \nothing$ is trivial so let $a_0 \in A$ and 
  $M := K(A \setminus \set{a_0})$ and assume inductively
  $0 < \EMB_K(M , N) \leq [M : K]$ with equality if
  all for all $a_1 \in A\setminus\set{a_0}$ 
  we have $\min(a_1 , K)$ with no repeated roots
  in $N$.
  Then $L = M(a_0)$.
  We have $\min(a_0, M)$ divides $\min(a_0, K)$ in $M[T]$,
  so $\min(a_0 , M)$ also splits into linear factors in $N[T]$.
  It follows from 
  \linkto{char_ext_simp}{the characterization of finite simple extensions}
  and the tower law
  that
  \[
    0 < \abs{\EMB_K(L , N)}
    = \sum_{\EMB_K(M , N)} \abs{\EMB_M(L , N)}
    \leq \sum_{\EMB_K(M , N)} [L : M]
    \leq [L : M] [M : K] = [L : K]
  \]
  Now assume all $\min(a , K)$ for $a \in A$ split into linear factors in $N$.
  This implies $\min(a_0 , M)$ splits into linear factors in $N$
  so $\abs{\EMB_M(L , N)} = [L : M]$.
  Then the first $\leq$ is an equality and the second is also
  by the induction hypothesis on $M$.

\end{proof}

\section{Normal and separable extensions}

Given an extension $K \to L = K(a_1 , \dots , a_n)$
with $a_i$ algebraic over $K$,
the embedding theorem for finite extensions tells us
how to construct automorphisms of $L$ over $K$.
For the main theorem of Galois theory to hold true,
we need to have the maximum number of automorphisms,
i.e. $\abs{\AUT_K L} = [L : K]$.
The embedding theorem indicates two ways in which this can fail : 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the polynomials $\min(a_i , K)$ do not split into
  linear factors in $L[X]$
  \item there exists some $a_i$ such that
  $\min(a_i , K)$ has a repeated root in $L$.
\end{enumerate}
These two phenomena are respectively called normality and separability.
Let us illustrate the failure of normality
by focusing on the extension
$\bQ \to \bQ(\al_0)$ from the first section.
Using the embedding theorem for finite simple extensions,
we see that $\si \in \EMB_\bQ(\bQ(\al_0) , \bQ(\al_0))$
correspond to solutions of $T^3 - 2$ in $\bQ(\al_0)$.
There is only $\al_0$:
If there is another root $\tilde{\al_1}$ then
$\tilde{\om} := \tilde{\al_1} / \al_0$ would be a primitive
cube root of unity and $[\bQ(\tilde{\om}) : \bQ] = 2$
which we cannot have as we saw before.
From this, we can see the problem is that 
$\bQ(\al_0) / \bQ$ does not contain
\emph{all} the roots of the polynomial $T^3 - 2$.
More precisely, $T^3 - 2$ does not factorise into linear factors
in $\bQ(\al_0)[T]$.
We can also see this phenomenon in the following way : 
there are three ways of $\bQ$-embedding $\bQ(\al_0)$ inside 
$\bQ(\al_0 , \al_1 , \al_2)$ corresponding to each $\bQ(\al_i)$
and their images are \emph{different}.

\begin{dfn} [\link{dfn:normal}{Normal Extension}] 
  
  Let $K \to L$ be an extension and $f \in K[X]$. 
  Then we say \emph{$L$ splits $f$} when 
  $f$ factorises into linear factors in $L[X]$. 

  Suppose $L/K$ is algebraic. 
  Then it is called \emph{normal} when for all $a \in L$,  
  it contains all the Galois $K$-conjugates of $a$,
  i.e. $L$ splits $\min(a,K)$. 
\end{dfn}

\begin{prop} [\link{thm:split}
  {Splitting Polynomials}]
  
  Let $K$ be a field and $f \in K[X] \setminus K$.
  Then there exists an extension $K \to L$ such that
  $f$ has a root in $L$. 
  In particular, there exists a $K$-extension that splits $f$. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Since $f$ is non-constant and $K[X]$ is a UFD, 
  there exists an irreducible $f_1$ that divides $f$.
  Let $L = K[X] / (f_1)$. 
  Then since $f_1$ is irreducible and $K[X]$ is a PID, 
  $L$ is a field and thus a $K$-extension. 
  Note that the image of the monomial $X$ in $L$ is a root of $f_1$,
  and hence a root of $f$.  
  To split $f$, use the above procedure to 
  inductively construct a desired extension.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop} [\link{thm:char_normal}
  {Characterisation of Finite Normal Extensions}]
  
  Let $K \to L$ be a finite extension.
  Then the following are equivalent : 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item (Contains all Galois $K$-Conjugates) $K \to L$ normal. 
    \item (Contains all Galois $K$-Conjugates of Generators) 
    There exists $A \subseteq L$ a finite set of generators of $K \to L$
    such that for all $a \in A$, 
    $a$ is algebraic over $K$ and $L$ splits $\min(a,K)$. 
    \item (is a Splitting Field) 
    There exists a polynomial $f \in K[X]$ such that
    $L$ splits $f$ and is generated by the roots of $f$ in $L$.
    \item (Image Invariance) For all extensions $K \to N$
    and two $\io_0, \io_1 \in \emb{K}{L}{N}$, 
    $\io_0 L = \io_1 L$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} $(1 \implies 2 \implies 3)$ is clear. 

  $(3 \implies 4)$ The key is that roots of $f$ remain roots of $f$
  under $K$-embeddings. 
  Let $f(X) = \prod_{k = 1}^{\deg f} (X - a_k) \in L[X]$.
  where $a_k \in L$.
  Then $f(X) = \prod_{k = 1}^{\deg f} (X - \io_0(a_k)) \in N[X]$
  For all $a_l$, since $\io_1$ fixes $K$ we get
  \[
    0 = \io_1(f(a_l)) = f(\io_1(a_l))
    = \prod_{k = 1}^{\deg f} (\io_1(a_l) - \io_0(a_k))
  \]
  so there exists $a_k$ such that $\io_1(a_l) = \io_0(a_k)$.
  Since $L = K(a_1,\dots,a_{\deg f})$, 
  this shows that $\io_1 L \subseteq \io_0 L$
  and by symmetry $\io_0 L \subseteq \io_1 L$ as well. 

  $(4 \implies 1)$ Let $a \in L$. 
  Since $(L,\io_L)$ is finite, $\min(a,K)$ exists.
  We do not know if $L$ splits $\min(a,K)$,
  but there exists an extension $L \to M$ such that 
  $M$ splits $\min(a,K)$.
  We seek to show that all Galois $K$-conjugates of $a$ in $M$ 
  are actually in (the image of) $L$ already.
  So let $\al \in M$ be a Galois $K$-conjugate of $a$. 
  We have the following situation. 
  \begin{figure} [H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzcd}
      K \arrow["\io_L",r] & 
      K(a) \arrow["\subseteq",r] \arrow["\phi_\al",rd] & 
      L \arrow["\io_M",d]\\
      & & M
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{figure}
  By the \linkto{lem:embed_simp}{embedding theorem for finite simple extensions}, 
  there exists $\phi_\al \in \emb{K}{K(a)}{M}$
  that maps $a \mapsto \al$. 
  Suppose we have an $\io_1 \in \emb{K(a)}{L}{\phi_\al}$.
  Then certainly $\io_1 \in \emb{K}{L}{\io_M \circ \io_L}$. 
  Also, trivially $\io_M \in \emb{K}{L}{\io_M \circ \io_L}$. 
  So $\io_1 L = \io_M L$ implies $\al \in \io_M L$ as desired. 
  It thus suffices to give an $\io_1 \in \emb{K(a)}{L}{\phi_\al}$. 
  Well, since $(L,\io_L)$ is finite, it is also a finite $K(a)$-extension, 
  so it is generated by some finite subset $B$
  whose elements are all algebraic over $K(a)$. 
  Then we can extend $M$ so that it splits all $\min(b,K(a))$ for $b \in B$. 
  Thus by the \linkto{thm:embed}{embedding theorem}, 
  we have an $\io_1 \in \emb{K(a)}{L}{\phi_\al}$. 
\end{proof}

Now let us discuss separability.
As we will see,
existence of inseparable irreducible polynomials
is linked with the \emph{characteristic} of the base field $K$.
This implies that 
in terms of finding an insolvable quintic over $\bQ$,
the problem of inseparable minimal polynomials never happens.

\begin{dfn} [\link{dfn:sep_poly}
  {Formal Derivative, Separable Polynomial, Separable extension}]
  
  Let $K$ be a field and $f = \sum_{0 \leq n} f_n X^n \in K[X]$. 
  Then the \emph{formal derivative of $f$} is defined to be 
  $f^\prime = \sum_{0 < n} n f_n X^{n-1}$. 

  $f$ is said to be \emph{separable} when 
  for all $K$-extensions in which $f$ splits, $f$ has no repeated roots. 
  If otherwise, $f$ is called \emph{inseparable}. 
  An algebraic extension $K \to L$ is called 
  separable when for all $a \in L$,
  the polynomial $\min(a , K)$ is separable.
\end{dfn}

To give an example of an inseparable extension,
we need to discuss the notion of the characteristic of a field.

\begin{dfn} [\link{dfn:char_field}
  {Characteristic of a Field}] 
  
  Let $K$ be a field. 
  $\bZ$ is generated by $1$ and ring morphisms must preserve $1$, 
  so there is a unique ring morphism $\bZ \to K$.
  Its image is an ID since $K$ is an ID.
  So by $\bZ$ PID, its kernel is generated by either zero or a (positive) prime. 
  This is defined as the \emph{characteristic of $K$},
  denoted $\Char{K}$.

  More generally, the characteristic of any integral domain $A$
  is defined in the same way.
\end{dfn}

\begin{eg}
  All fields $K$ of characteristic 0 have a unique 
  extension map $\bQ \to K$.
  Similarly, all fields $K$ of characteristic $p > 0$
  have a unique extension map $\bF_p \to K$.
\end{eg}

The following is the root of all interesting phenomena
in positive characteristic.

\begin{prop}[Freshman's dream]
  
  Let $A$ be an integral domain of characteristic $p > 0$
  and $a , b \in A$.
  Then $(a + b)^p = a^p + b^p$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  The point is that the binomial coefficient 
  $\begin{pmatrix}
    p \\ k
  \end{pmatrix}$
  for $0 < k < p$ is divisible by $p$.
\end{proof}

\begin{eg}
  Consider $K = \bF_p(T) := \mathrm{Frac}\,\bF_p[T]$
  and the polynomial $f(X) = X^p - T \in K[X]$.
  Then by Eisenstein's criterion $f$ is irreducible.
  Let $L := K[X] / (f)$ and $T^{1 / p}$ the image of $X$ in $L$.
  Then in $L[X]$ we have by Freshman's dream \[
    f(X) = X^p - T = X^p - (T^{1 / p})^p
    = (X - T^{1 / p})^p
  \]
  So $f$ is inseparable.
\end{eg}

% \begin{prop} [\link{thm:char_insep_irr_poly}
%   {Characterisation of Inseparable Irreducible Polynomials}]
  
%   Let $K$ be a field and $f \in K[X]$ irreducible. 
%   Then the following are equivalent : 
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item (Repeated Root) $f$ is inseparable. 
%     \item (Intrinsic Definition) $(f,f^\prime) \neq 1$.
%     \item (Another Intrinsic Definition) $f^\prime = 0$.
%     \item (Characteristic Non-zero) 
%     $\Char{K} = p \neq 0$ and 
%     there exists an irreducible separable $g \in K[X]$ with $n > 0$ such that 
%     $f(X) = g(X^{p^n})$. 
%     \item (All Roots Repeated) There exists a $K$-extension in which 
%     $f$ splits and all its roots are repeated. 
%   \end{enumerate}
% \end{prop}
% \begin{proof}
%   ($1 \implies 2$) Suppose $(f , f^\prime) = 1$.
%   Then by the Euclidean algorithm there exists
%   $\la, \mu \in K[X]$ such that $\la f + \mu f^\prime = 1$.
%   Let $K \to L$ be an extension where $f$ has a repeated root $a$.
%   By factoring $f(X) = (X - a)^2 g(X)$ in $L[X]$ and the product rule
%   for formal differentiation (which can be proved by induction),
%   we see a contradiction \[
%     1 = \la(a) f(a) + \mu(a) f^\prime(a) = 0 + 0 = 0
%   \]

%   ($2 \implies 3$) 
%   If $f^\prime \neq 0$ then since $(f , f^\prime) \neq 1$
%   and $f$ is irreducible, we must have that
%   $f$ divides $f^\prime$.
%   But then $\deg f \leq \deg f^\prime < \deg f$
%   so we must have $f^\prime = 0$.

%   ($3 \implies 4$)
%   We do induction on $\deg f$.
%   By rescaling, WLOG assume $f$ is monic.
%   Then looking at the leading coefficient of $f^\prime$,
%   we see that $\deg f = 0$ as elements inside $K$.
%   Since $\deg f > 0$ we have that $\Char{K} = p > 0$ for some prime $p$.
%   Writing $f(X) = \sum_{k \geq 0} f_k X^k$
%   and looking at $f^\prime = 0$,
%   we see that for every $f_k \neq 0$ we must have $k = 0$ in $K$.
%   In other words $k = p k_p$ for some $k_p \in \bN$.
%   Letting $g(X) = \sum_{k \geq 0} f_k X^{k_p}$ we get
%   $f(X) = g(X^p)$.
%   If $g$ is reducible then $f$ is reducible 
%   so we must have $g$ is irreducible.
%   If $g$ is separable, we are done.
%   If $g$ is inseparable,
%   then using $(1 \implies 3)$ we have $g^\prime = 0$.
%   Since $\deg g < \deg f$ we are done by induction.

%   ($4 \implies 5$)
%   Let $K \to L$ with $g(X) = (X - a_1) \dots (X - a_d)$ in $L[X]$.
%   We can extend $L$ further to split the polynomials
%   $X^{p^n} - a_i$.
%   Let $b_i \in L$ such that $b_i^{p^n} = a_i$.

\section{Galois extensions and the fundamental theorem}

\begin{dfn}
  An extension $K \to L$ is called Galois
  when there exists a finite subgroup $G \subs \AUT_K L$
  such that $K = L^G$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{prop}[Characterization of Galois extensions]
  Let $K \to L$ be an extension.
  Then $K \to L$ is finite, normal, separable
  iff $K \to L$ is Galois.
  In this case $K = L^{\AUT_K L}$ and $\abs{\AUT_K L} = [L : K]$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  ($1 \implies 2$)
  By the embedding theorem, $\abs{\AUT_K L} \leq [L : K]$.
  We claim that $G := \AUT_K L$ works.
  Let $a \in L^G$. Goal : $a \in K$.
  Since $K \to L$ is normal, $\min(a, K)$ splits in $L$.
  It suffices to show it is linear.
  Since $K \to L$ is separable, it suffices to show
  that any Galois $K$-conjugate $\al \in L$ of $a$
  we have $\al = a$.
  Let $\al \in L$ with $\min(a , K)(\al) = 0$.
  Since $a \in L^G$ is suffices to give $\si \in \AUT_K L$
  which $\si(a) = \al$.
  By the embedding theorem applied to $K(a) \to L$,
  we can extend $K(a) \simeq K(\al) \to L$ to an automorphism
  $\si : L \to L$ preserving $K$.
  This maps $a$ to $\al$ as desired.

  ($2 \implies 1$) More tricky.

\end{proof}
